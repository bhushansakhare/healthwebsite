<h1>Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Tips and tools to support your health & wellbeing with IBD</h1>
<p>According to the CDCTrusted Source, approximately 3.1 millionTrusted Source adults in the United States have been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This includes two conditions, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, which are the result of prolonged inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

Today the primary approach used by doctors to examine GI issues includes endoscopy and manometry, both of which are invasive procedures carried out in hospital environments.

Scientists are looking into an alternative approach where GI monitoring can take place with portable and non-invasive procedures. This would include a video capsule endoscopy (VCE) and wireless motility capsules. Ideally, this approach would be more practical and more comfortable for the patient.

Keeping this in mind, researchers at the California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created and tested a new prototype, a location-aware ingestible to monitor the GI tract, which may be valuable for the diagnosis and treatment of GI disorders. The researchTrusted Source was published this month in the journal Nature Electronics.

At this stage, the three-dimensional (3D) localization and tracking of the device has only been conducted in the GI tracts of large animals. Further research is needed before human clinical trials can begin.</p>

<p>Researchers have a location-aware ingestible to monitor the GI tract, which can be valuable for the diagnosis and treatment of GI disorders.
Gastroenterologists agree this device may be a helpful tool in the future.
Since more studies on the smart pill need to be conducted, it’s important to be aware of signs that you have gastrointestinal problems. These include symptoms such as diarrhea, anemia, joint swelling, bleeding in stools, abdominal pain, weight loss, and nausea.</p>
