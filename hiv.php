<h1>A Comprehensive Guide to HIV and AIDS</h1>


<p>AIDS is a disease that can develop in people who have the HIV virus. Treatment with antiretroviral drugs can typically prevent AIDS from developing in people with HIV.</p>

<h1>What is HIV?</h1>
HIV is a virus that damages the immune system. Untreated HIV affects and kills CD4 cells, which are a type of immune cell called T cell.

Over time, as HIV kills more CD4 cells, the body is more likely to get various types of conditions and cancers.

HIV is transmitted through bodily fluids that include:

blood
semen
vaginal and rectal fluids
breast milk
The virus isn’t transferred in air or water, or through casual contact.

Because HIV inserts itself into the DNA of cells, it’s a lifelong condition and currently there’s no drug that eliminates HIV from the body, although many scientists are working to find one.

However, with medical care, including treatment called antiretroviral therapy, it’s possible to manage HIV and live with the virus for many years.

Without treatment, a person with HIV is likely to develop a serious condition called the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, known as AIDS.

At that point, the immune system is too weak to successfully respond against other diseases, infections, and conditions.

Untreated, life expectancy with end stage AIDS is about 3 yearsTrusted Source. With antiretroviral therapy, HIV can be well-managed, and life expectancy can be nearly the same as someone who has not contracted HIV.

It’s estimated that 1.2 million Americans are currently living with HIV. Of those people, 1 in 7 don’t know they have the virus.

HIV can cause changes throughout the body.

<h1>What is AIDS?</h1>
AIDS is a disease that can develop in people with HIV. It’s the most advanced stage of HIV. But just because a person has HIV doesn’t mean AIDS will develop.

HIV kills CD4 cells. Healthy adults generally have a CD4 count of 500 to 1,600 per cubic millimeter. A person with HIV whose CD4 count falls below 200 per cubic millimeter will be diagnosed with AIDS.

A person can also be diagnosed with AIDS if they have HIV and develop an opportunistic infection or cancer that’s rare in people who don’t have HIV.

An opportunistic infection such as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is one that only occurs in a severely immunocompromised person, such as someone with advanced HIV infection (AIDS).

Untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS within a decade. There’s currently no cure for AIDS, and without treatment, life expectancy after diagnosis is about 3 yearsTrusted Source
